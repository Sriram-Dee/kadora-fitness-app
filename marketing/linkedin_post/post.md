## 🚀 The Post

**Headline**: From Concept to Live Deployment in UNDER 60 Minutes

I just built and deployed **Kadora Fitness**, a modern React application, using a single AI agent powered by the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

The goal was ambitious: take a blank slate and turn it into a deployed, functional, and beautiful application in one sitting.

**The Workflow:**

1.  🎨 **Design**: We started with high-fidelity mockups using **Stitch** to nail the aesthetic (Neon Green/Dark Mode).
2.  💻 **Build**: The agent scaffolded the project with **React 19, Vite, and Tailwind CSS v4**.
3.  🛠️ **Refine**: Integrated **Shadcn/UI** components, interactive charts, and a dynamic theme manager.
4.  🚀 **Deploy**: Automated the git initialization and deployment to **GitHub Pages**.

This demonstrates the power of **Agentic AI** + **MCP**. It's not just about writing code; it's about understanding the _entire_ lifecycle of software development.
